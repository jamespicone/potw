The woman who would become Battery had a problem. Her father, a detective, would put in immense amounts of work getting villains arrested and sent to the Birdcage, and it would all come to nothing. A cape going by the name Madcap claimed he was ideologically opposed to the Birdcage and everything it represented, and he kept freeing villains en-route. And she could do nothing.

As she surfed the darkweb looking at sketchy sites promising to sell Tinker-made equipment she could use to put down Madcap, she was contacted by a secretive organisation calling itself Cauldron. They offered her superpowers, at a ruinous price. But if she promised to do three favours for them in the future, they could sell her powers for merely everything she had.

She said yes, and became Battery. And for her first favour, Cauldron asked her to join the Wards.

Now, with a power she doesn't understand, she intends to stop Madcap and make the world make sense again.
