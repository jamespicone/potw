After her brother's death, when Sarah hinted to her parents that Reggie had been acting a bit weird, they hated her. They blamed her for his death; they claimed that if she'd said something it could have been prevented. It all culminated in a dream - a nightmare, really - where something inside Sarah snapped. She woke up with the ability to just know things, to infer details she couldn't possibly have known. Her parents turned on a dime when they realised how useful she was now, and she could see right through them.

So she stole some money and ran.

Now she lives on the streets, supporting herself with well-targeted thefts of bank cards; predicting people's PINs. And if anyone tries to stop her? She cuts deep into their psyche, supplementing her power with raw cold reading, hurting people until she can get away.
