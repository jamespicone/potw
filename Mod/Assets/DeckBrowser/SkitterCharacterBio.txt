Reserved and introspective, anyone who knew Taylor Hebert would be unlikely to guess that she leads a double life as a villain Skitter. The newest recruit of the Undersiders, her perfect control over every bug in a multiple-block radius makes her a terrifying opponent. Skitter confronts her foes with massive swarms of buzzing flies, a horde of spiders, carried by flights of beetles. That would be threatening enough, but Skitter herself is creative and devious, and she has incredible situational awareness thanks to her arthopodovoyance.

But Taylor has a secret: she wants to be a hero. Once she's embedded enough in the Undersiders, once their mysterious patron trusts her enough, once she knows who they are - then she can take that information to the Protectorate, and then it'll all be worth it. Won't it?
