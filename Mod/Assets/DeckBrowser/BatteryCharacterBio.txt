Battery is an up-and-coming member of the Protectorate ENE, moving there after a stint with the Wards in New York, where she was mentored by Legend. She's a speedster, of a sort, able to focus to build up a charge she can spend to become incredibly fast and strong for seconds at a time. She can also discharge with a burst of electromagnetic energy, yanking metal around and frying electronics.

Battery is well-respected in Brockton Bay for her serious demeanour and professionalism. She's often paired up with Assault for patrols due to the significant synergy between their powers, and the media often speculate about their relationship outside of work.
