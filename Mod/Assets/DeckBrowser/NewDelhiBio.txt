It is July of 2011, and the Endbringer Behemoth is attacking New Delhi. The first Endbringer fight since Alexandrias's death is a concerning prospect, but the international cape community has rallied and attendance is at record levels. India's cape community has turned out in force - both the Thanda and the Garama - and China's Yangban have turned out for their first foreign Endbringer fight.

Even with all those advantages, an Endbringer fight in such a highly-populated city is a daunting thought.
