Five years after Behemoth's appearance capes had adapted to his attacks. They still weren't prepared for a thirty-foot-tall scaled monster to burst out of the sea near Oslo. Tactics adapted for Behemoth's lumbering power were not well matched to Leviathan's speed and macrohydrokinesis, as tidal waves tore apart defensive lines. Leviathan displayed sizeable cunning in the use of his long, lashing tail and the water continually pouring off of him as he moved, his shadow of water.

Three years later, in Japan, Leviathan demonstrated the cost of failure. Over a several-hour battle, Leviathan fractured the continental sheet with incredible water pressure, sinking the entire island of Kyushu into the sea, killing millions. Every fight against the Endbringer Leviathan, the Citykiller, carries the heavy understanding that if he is not driven off, that situation can be repeated.
