During the Simurgh's 2009 attack on Madison, Wisconsin, seven teenagers from Earth Aleph were transported to Earth Bet. In the wreckage of the Simurgh's attack they found six mysterious vials, with paperwork explaining that they were bottled superpowers. Eventually they decided to drink the vials and use their newfound powers to escape the quarantine zone and somehow find their way back home, becoming [b]the Travellers[/b].

Noelle shared half a vial with another traveller, Oliver, and they quickly discovered that his was a serious mistake.

By now, Noelle's lower body is an elephantine mass of tissues, tentacles, and limbs; sickly green and dark throbbing red; a living creature as designed by a malfunctioning neural network. She is practically unkillable, regenerating fast enough it's visible. When she makes contact with someone she can produce distorted clones of them, with variants of their powers and the desire to ruin their lives.

And in the back of her head is a now a growing bloodlust, a hunger that cannot be sated. She worked hard to keep it restrained while the rest of the Travellers worked with Coil to find a cure, but after Coil's death at the hands of the Undersiders, well, she has no hope left.

Maybe it's time to listen to the voice in the back of her head.
