Rachel doesn't like people; they've never done anything food for her and they're always lying, playing stupid social games, laughing at her behind her back. She much prefers dogs. She understands dogs; she's good at training them, and her power lets them be big and strong, car-sized monsters of bone and muscle until it wears off.

Crime is the easiest way she can make the money she needs to survive and keep her dogs well, and she's no stranger to violence, but she's no monster; she'll pitch in against S-class threats or the really bad people.

She's not really with the Undersiders because they're friends. Their backer promised her protection and money if she joined up, so she did. If it wasn't for that, she'd be gone in a heartbeat.
