The Protectorate aren't stupid; they know that parahumans are traumatized, almost by definition. Not only that, but the things they deal with tend to just make the trauma worse. To deal with this, the PRT has a cohort of psychologists and they mandate that their Wards and Protectorate members spend some time with them regularly. The effect is spoiled somewhat by rotating the psychologists regularly (to prevent them manipulating their patients).

Jessica is one of those psychologists. She spent eight years in grad school to earn the questionable privilege of helping child superheroes with their issues, with a side career working with Case 53s. She wouldn't give it up for anything.
