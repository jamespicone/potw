Jessica Yamada's original design made her not a target. Unfortunately this doesn't work well in the SOTM Digital engine. This variant attempts to make a non-target hero character work properly in the engine. It may have some surprising behaviour or not work well in some circumstances. I will look into bug reports, but it's entirely possible that I won't be able to do anything about them. Use with caution.
