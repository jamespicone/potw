Dauntless is something of a hometown hero in Brockton Bay, a local hero who is expected to make it big on the world stage. Every day he builds up a 'charge', and he can infuse that charge into things he's holding or wearing, slowly, slowly making them formidable artefacts. His Arclance strikes at incredible ranges, becoming energy or physical matter as necessary; his Arcshield projects a forcefield; and his boots make him fast and allow him to fly. Nobody knows what his upper limits will be, if he even has any.

Personally, Dauntless is personable. He is quiet, and very concerned about truly being a [i]hero[/i], not just a man with superpowers. He loves his son and still cares for his ex-partner, who left him shortly after his trigger event.

The Protectorate values him highly as an asset, and he is under strict instruction to focus on his mobility and defence. When he has become practically unkillable, then he can focus on his Arclance, and they'll find out if he has limits - and maybe, just maybe, he can kill an Endbringer.
