In December 2002 a five-metre tall naked woman dropped out of the sky in Lausanne, Switzerland. She was covered in gigantic, asymmetrically-placed wings, and appeared to interact with people around her - looking at people who tried to talk to her, sometimes gesturing.

Three days later, she began her psychic scream and Lausanne boiled over with violence; the people she had been subtly influencing becoming killers. Central Europe has still not fully recovered from the first attack of the third Endbringer, the Simurgh.

The pattern quickly became obvious. The Simurgh would fly into a city and begin her psychic scream, the song in people's heads driving emotional extremes and giving people hallucinations. Capes would arrive to drive her off and she would fight back with telekinesis and her precognition, and eventually she would leave. And then the world would wait with bated breath to see what the [i]real[/i] attack was - would a civilian caught in the event assassinate a political leader? Would a hero go rogue and kill their teammates? The aftershocks were always worse than the immediate effects, and it was never clear where the boundaries of her influence ended. When governments brought in draconian laws against survivors of Simurgh attacks, was that part of her plan or not?

What is she planning?
