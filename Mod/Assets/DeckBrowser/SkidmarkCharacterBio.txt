It may seem absurd that such a weak parahuman runs a notable gang in Brockton Bay, but the Merchants are no ordinary gang. Skidmark's Shaker power - coating surfaces in a deflection field that pushes things away from them - is not a significant component of Skidmark's actual powerbase. None of the other members of the Merchants have top-tier powers either.

The key component is that the Merchant's drug operations are massive, and in a city wracked with unemployment and suffering they're immensely popular. The Merchants may be trash, but there are enough of them to overwhelm any other gang or team in the city.
