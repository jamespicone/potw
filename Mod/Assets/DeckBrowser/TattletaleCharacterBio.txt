Tattletale serves as ops and intelligence for the Undersiders, using her superpowered intuition as a force multiplier. Her insights into guard locations, parahuman powers, people's motivations, passwords, building layouts, and more are a key component of the Undersiders' effectiveness.

Tattletale herself is abrasive; driven to continually poke at people's weaknesses and secrets. As far as her better qualities go, she's intensely loyal to her team, and she's quite willing to help humanity against the real monsters.
