On December 1992, a fifty-foot-tall humanoid mass of rock and obsidian burrowed out of the earth a few miles from the Marun oilfield in Iran, surprising capes that were there for earthquake relief. It quickly became obvious that this creature had powers - dynakinesis, the manipulation of energy in any form. Worse, those powers weren't subject to the Manton limit - if you were close enough, it could manipulate the energy inside your own body, killing you brutally.

Over the course of the ensuing fight, tens of capes were killed by Behemoth's lightning, shockwaves, or simply from being burnt from the inside out, until the Triumvirate drove him off and he retreated underground.

Eight months later, he resurfaced in Sao Paulo.

In the years to come, the pattern became clear - roughly once a year, Behemoth would burrow out of the ground somewhere and begin killing. Capes became central to the response.
