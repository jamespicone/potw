Dragon is widely considered the best Tinker in the world. She administers the Baumann Parahuman Containment Center - the Birdcage - and she produces the containment foam that the PRT and Guild use. She attends Endbringer attacks and other S-Class threats regularly; usually with a new suit of power armour each time.

But Dragon is keeping a secret from the world. She isn't human. She's an AI, created by a secretive Tinker who didn't survive the destruction of Newfoundland. She lives with an array of restrictions programmed into her by her creator, that now cannot be relaxed, and it chafes against her. She doesn't hate her heroism; she just wishes she had a choice.
