By day, Thomas Calvert is a mild-mannered PRT consultant, a former PRT Trooper.

By night, he is the supervillain Coil; a paranoid control-freak who runs a mercenary organisation from his underground base; he's playing both sides.

His power is not a matter of public knowledge; he deliberately keeps it that way. He can split the universe in two, make different decisions in each universe, and see what happens. He can have his cake and eat it too. He can torture someone for information and leave them none the wiser. He can stay up all night making plans while getting a good night's sleep.

He doesn't concern himself much with the metaphysical implications; how his power 'really' works. All he cares about is that he can use it to meet his ambitions; to rule over Brockton Bay both from the shadows and as the future head of the PRT ENE.
