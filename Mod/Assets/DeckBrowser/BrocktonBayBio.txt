Brockton Bay is a small port city in the US Northeast, just north of Boston. It's climate is mild, but the local economy has suffered badly from a collapse of the shipping industry.

It is also one of the top 10 cities in the US by cape population. Combined with its small population, that makes Brockton Bay one of the most cape-dense environments in America.
