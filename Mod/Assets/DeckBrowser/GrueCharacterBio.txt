Serious, careful, and practical, Brian 'Grue' Laborn does not match the public's image of a parahuman criminal. After triggering and developing his power - the ability to create and spread clouds of stifling darkness - he took it as an opportunity to make some money and become independent. Distrustful of authority and concerned that the restrictions and regimentation of the Wards program would limit his ability to care for his younger sister, Aisha, low-level crime seemed better. When a mysterious benefactor offered him a team and a regular paycheck, he jumped at the chance, forming the Undersiders with Tattletale, Bitch, and Regent.

The Undersiders play by the unwritten rules, though. They're not heroes, and Grue isn't planning on joining the Protectorate any time soon, but they're not out to hurt people. And against the people who do, or when the Endbringer sirens go off, Grue will stand with the heroes.
