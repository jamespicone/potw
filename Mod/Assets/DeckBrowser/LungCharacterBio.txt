Lung is a terrifying gang leader; a pyrokinetic and brute. His power ramps up the longer he's in a fight; slowly transforming him into a creature out of a nightmare, capable of standing up to an Endbringer. He was present for the destruction of Kyushu and escaped the Yangban, and now he intends rule Brockton Bay with fear.

Lung believes every Asian citizen of Brockton Bay is his to command, and his de-facto control of some of the slums of Brockton Bay lets him conscript the members he wants. His gang, the Azn Bad Boys, commands a handful of other parahumans - the teleporter Oni Lee and the bomb Tinker Bakuda.
