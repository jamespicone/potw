Elle triggered young; like many young parahumans, her power affected her mind. It causes disassociation and fugue states; on her bad days she barely speaks; reality drowned out by her pocket worlds. She was placed in a parahuman asylum, which did not help her mental health. Mimi - Burnscar - was another patient of the same asylum, and developed a one-sided affection for Elle. The staff used visits to Elle as a reward for encourage Mimi to behave. Her pocket worlds became nightmares as a reflection of her mental state; uncontrolled power expressions earned her Shaker 12 rating.

When Faultline's crew of mercenaries hit Elle's asylum on a mission, she took the opportunity to escape - as did Mimi. Faultline took her in, and the combination of her new found family and therapy got her to a better place. With hard work and unwavering support, she has begun making beautiful things.

Her power is incredibly flexible. She creates and maintains pocket worlds, vast alternate dimensions accessible only by her. Then, she can impose those worlds on local reality, making the battlefield her plaything. The longer she stays in an area the more she gets her hooks in; the range she can affect increasing. Unfortunately, there is an inverse relationship between her mental health and her power; on her good days the window in her mind is shrunk to a sliver. On her bad days, she is truly terrifying.
