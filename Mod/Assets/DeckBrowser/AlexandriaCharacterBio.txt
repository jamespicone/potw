Alexandria leads the Protectorate in Los Angeles, and is a member of the Triumvirate, the three most prominent of the United States heroes. Together with Eidolon and Legend she responds to Endbringer attacks and S-class threats the world over; an inspiration to many.

She can fly at supersonic speeds, is near-invulnerable to physical harm, and can bring incredible strength to bear; a powerset that has since come to be referred to as the "Alexandria package". Since becoming active in the late 1980s, she's acquired a reputation as an implacable and formidable foe. She is always prepared to put herself between danger and her allies.
