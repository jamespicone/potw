Hana was a child when her village was attacked and her parents were murdered amidst a separatist conflict in Turkey. Afterwards, the soldiers led the children from the village in front of them to find mines and other traps. Convinced she was going to die, Hana triggered; she had a vision and became a parahuman. Crackling green-black energy appeared near her; when she touched it, it solidified into a gun. Finding that she could change it to other weapons at will, Hana used it to kill the soldiers, and then fled with the rest of the surviving children.

She hoped to hide her gift, but the refugee organisation she ended up with evacuated her via plane. In the airport her gun was found, and more importantly they found it couldn't be taken from her. She ended up in the United States, taken by a man in a military uniform, where she was placed with a foster family and joined one of the first Ward teams, alongside other young capes like Chevalier and Mouse Protector.

Today, she is Miss Militia, an experienced hero. Her power lets her have the perfect weapon for the situation and gives her preternatural ability with it. She's regarded highly; a hero who takes care to be truly [i]heroic[/i]; to chart the right course in a difficult world. Chatter is that she'll likely be promoted in the future...
