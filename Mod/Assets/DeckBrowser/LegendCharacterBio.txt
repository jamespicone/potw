Legend leads the Protectorate, the official superhero team of the United States. His blue-and-white costume is an icon throughout North America; and he's well-known for his charisma and leadership skills. He's also notable for being a parahuman with a family in the public eye; his (anonymised) joint interview with his husband was a significant event in parahuman history.

A member of the Triumvirate, Legend is also packing incredible personal power. The very definition of flying artillery, Legend's powers allow him to shoot lasers with a wide variety of effects - burning, freezing, cutting, bludgeoning, turning around corners, splitting into more lasers, and more besides. If that wasn't enough, he can fly, and fast too - he's one of the fastest heroes on record, with no known upper limit. In order to facilitate these incredible speeds, he shifts into an energy form as he travels faster, and also when attacked, allowing him to absorb more damage than you might expect.
