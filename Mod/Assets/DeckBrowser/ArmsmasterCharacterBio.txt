Armsmaster leads the Protectorate ENE. His Tinker abilities grant him a profound understanding of combining and miniaturising technology beyond current science. He exploits that by building and maintaining a number of Halberds, his signature weapon, a spear packed with gadgets and tricks that he can use to fight any opponent. Together with his power armour and single-minded focus on his job, he is a stalwart and unflinching hero... though perhaps not a pleasant person to be around.
